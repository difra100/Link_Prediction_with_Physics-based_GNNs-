# Link Prediction with Physics-based GNNs
### Repository's Content
This repository contains the developement and code implementation for my Master's degree thesis.  
The topic of my thesis concerns the design and development of a Physics-based GNN for link prediction in the Graph domain.  
### Repository Description
* node_class_test.ipynb : This is a notebook that contains some notes and also some preliminary implementation of actual code.
* GRAFF.py : This python script contains the implementation for GRAFF, which is the Physics-based GNN.
* Experiments.ipynb : This notebook contains the pytorch-lightning code of the experiments.
* config.py : The hyperparameters and other important variable are set in this script.
